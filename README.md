# Proctor Bypass Script

This script is designed to bypass proctoring measures in online exams. It requires the [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) extension for your browser (Firefox, Chrome, etc.).

## Features
- Bypass focus tab: Allows you to open other tabs while taking your exam without being detected.
- Fake camera: Simulates a live camera feed, so you can take the exam without being monitored.
- ~~Save session: Automatically saves your exam progress, so you can resume later if needed.~~
- Hide panel: Panel can be hidden by double clicking on it.
